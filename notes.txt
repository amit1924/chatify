🧩 What --prefix means

The --prefix <folder> flag tells npm:
👉 “Run this command as if you were inside that folder.”

So instead of cd backend && npm install, you can stay in the root and just do it in one line.

⚛️ npm run build --prefix frontend
→ runs the build script defined inside frontend/package.json (Vite build).

app.use(express.static(...))

📂 express.static is middleware that tells Express:
👉 “Whenever someone requests a file (like /index.html or /style.css), go look inside this folder and serve it.”

path.join(__dirname, '../frontend/dist')

🛣 Builds the full file path to your frontend build folder:

__dirname → current backend folder.

../frontend/dist → steps one level up, then into frontend/dist.

🎬 Example

Say your project is:
backend/server.js
frontend/dist/index.html
frontend/dist/assets/index.js

When a user hits / in the browser:

🔍 Express looks in frontend/dist.

Finds index.html.

Sends it back → React app loads.

When a user hits /about:

React handles it in client-side routing (after Express serves index.html).
